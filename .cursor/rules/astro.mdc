# Project Guidelines

## Commit Message Guidelines

- **Format**: Follow the conventional commits specification.

  ```text
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer(s)]
  ```

- **Rules**:
  - Always suggest a conventional commit with a type and optional scope in lowercase letters.
  - Keep the commit message concise and within 60 characters.
  - Ensure the commit message is ready to be pasted into the terminal without further editing.
  - Provide the full command to commit, not just the message.
- **Example**:
  - User: `/commit` (with diff context)
  - Assistant: `git commit -m 'feat: add responsive navbar with TailwindCSS'`

## Development Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Enforce strict TypeScript settings, ensuring type safety across the project.
- **TailwindCSS**: Use TailwindCSS for all styling, keeping the utility-first approach in mind.
- **Astro Components**: Ensure Astro components are modular, reusable, and maintain a clear separation of concerns.

## Coding Style

- **File Headers**: Code must start with path/filename as a one-line comment.

  ```typescript
  // src/components/Card.astro
  ```

- **Comments**: Comments should describe purpose, not effect.
- **Principles**: Prioritize modularity, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, and performance.

## Custom Commands

- **/commit**: Generate a Git commit message using the conventional commits spec.
